# HelloNotes Architecture Rules
- Target Environment: macOS 15+ / Swift 5.10+ / Xcode 26
- Multiplatform: One shell, `AdaptiveShell`, chosen by the *axis of abundance* (width/height), never by device — a Mac window and an iPad of the same size get the same layout. See `docs/layout-architecture.md`.
- The window has **exactly one collapsible column**: a sidebar holding a *single tree* — Recents and Bookmarks pinned at the top, then one root per open collection, expanding into that collection's folders. SwiftUI only gives a correctly-placed sidebar toggle to column one, which is why everything navigational lives there and **no command may live inside it** (a hidden command is an unreachable command). Commands go in the toolbar: search leading, New Note / Open Quickly centre, the five inspector toggles trailing. See `docs/shell-chrome.md`.
- Anything keyed on a collection (the outline cache key, drop targets, "New Note" at a root) reads the sidebar's selection. **A cache key must name everything the cached value depends on** — keying the outline on one collection made opening or closing another invisible.
- State: Use the `@Observable` macro exclusively. DO NOT use legacy `@ObservableObject` or `@StateObject`.
- Data Source: No CoreData. The local file system directory is the absolute source of truth.
- Git Operations: Use `SwiftGitX` (Import `SwiftGitX`) utilizing native Swift async/await concurrency.
- Build Verification: After writing code, use the Xcode MCP tool to run a compilation check to ensure 0 errors.

# Layout
- App: `HelloNotes/` — `Core/` (parsing, FileIO, indexes), `State/` (@Observable services), `UI/`, `LLM/`; `UI/Shell/` holds the layout contract; `MacContentView` / `iOSContentView` supply its slots.
- Editor: `Packages/NotesEditor` (MarkdownCore / MarkdownEditor / GFMRender) — the app's only editor; the old engine fork is gone.
- Website: `website/` (Astro 7 + Tailwind 4) — see `website/CLAUDE.md` and `docs/website.md`.
- Docs: shipped work → `docs/implemented.md`; backlog only → `docs/unimplemented.md`.

# Commands
- Build (macOS, full CLI build): `xcodebuild -project HelloNotes.xcodeproj -scheme HelloNotes build` — the Xcode MCP check above is the quick per-change gate; use this for full/Release verification.
- Editor tests: `swift test --package-path Packages/NotesEditor`
- Layout contract: `xcodebuild test -project HelloNotes.xcodeproj -scheme HelloNotes -destination 'platform=macOS' -only-testing:HelloNotesTests/ShellContractTests` (~2s, headless — run it after any shell or representable change).
- Live verification: run `scripts/relaunch-debug.sh` first — plain `open` reuses a stale instance and you test the wrong binary.
- Release/DMG: use the `/release` skill (`docs/production.md` Appendix A2 is authoritative).

# Hard-won rules
- Cold builds take 30–47 min (74 targets). A long `xcodebuild` is a cold build, not a hang.
- Debug proves nothing about Release: check `-configuration Release` before archiving (a Release-only optimizer crash once broke every archive — implemented.md §13).
- A viewport must report the size it is **offered**, never the size it **contains**. Every representable wrapping a scrolling/content-sized view implements `sizeThatFits` via `viewportSizeThatFits` and never returns `nil` — `nil` means "ask the platform view", whose `fittingSize` is the whole document (3433pt for a 76-line note), which inflates every ancestor until the top of the content sits above the window, unreachable. Pair every `minWidth/minHeight` with a maximum. Details: implemented.md §17.
- Vault content I/O goes through `Core/FileIO` (coordinated), never `String(contentsOf:)`/`.write(to:)` — raw reads of dataless cloud files fail with EDEADLK. The `vault-io-reviewer` agent checks this.
- `project.pbxproj`: git is the source of truth. Never accept an Xcode regenerate/modernize prompt; recover with `git checkout HEAD -- HelloNotes.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`.
- Secrets: `Config/Secrets.xcconfig` (git-ignored) holds provider keys; the DMG bakes in whatever it held at build time. Never touch the repo-root `.env`.
- Docs describe the UI from source, not memory — verify shortcuts/menus with the `docs-fact-checker` agent (a draft once shipped two invented shortcuts).
- Commit trailer: `Co-Authored-By: Claude <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>` per repo convention.
